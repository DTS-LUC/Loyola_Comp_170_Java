Pseduo Code:

	Task: 	
			Write a simple program that takes values from the user and outputs the factorial of that value.
			Use a recursive function to calculate the factorial. 

	Definition of Factorial:
			- The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
				- 0! = 1; 1! = 1

			- In order to calculate the factorial we will use the equation:
							n! = n * (n - 1)!
				
				Example:	3! = 3 * 2!
							2! = 2 * 1!
							1! = 1
						By substituting the terms we get 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

	Procedure:
		Create Variables:
			0. Create two integer variable (num, ans) and one character variable (rept)
				-	Assign rept value to 'y'

		Take User Input:
			1. The program will begin to loop while " rept == 'y' "
				- This loop will contain all of the remaining processes
				- This is so the user can eventually choose to exit or repeat the program

			2. Next the program will request the value to be calculated
				- This value will be assigned to num

			3. Then the program will check that: num >= 0
				- while num is less than 0, the user will be asked to enter a new value

		Calculate the Factorial:
			4. It will then pass the value of num to the factorial method

			5. nb will be assigned the value passed to the method

			6. The return value of the method will depend on two cases

			Case 1: nb <= 1
				For this case the method will return the integer value 1

			Case 2: nb > 1
				In this case the method will return the value:
					nb * (nb - 1)!
				
				In order to calculate (nb - 1) the method will call another instance of the factorial method
			
			Example: nb = 3
				0. factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2)
				1. factorial(2) = 2 * factorial(1)
				2. factorial(1) = 1
				3. factorial(3) = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

			7.	ans will then be assigned return value of the initial factorial calculation

			8. The program will then output the value inputed and its factoral

			9. The user will then be asked if they would like to repeat or quit the program
